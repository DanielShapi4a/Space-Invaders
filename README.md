# Space-Invaders
a C# game, somewhere in between space invaders and chicken invaders with a level editor system. made with @daniel-papkov.

This was a course assignment that asked us to follow a specific inheritance structure.
We decided to make a game close to chicken invaders, it has a built in level editor and stage saving features.
There are comments explaining everything if you want to pick up the project and keep adding features to it.
The game was built for a proof of concept more than it was meant to be played ,meaning we didn't optimize everything possible.
So adding an absurd number of enemies will cause the game to run in "slow motion" never the less it is pretty fun I recommend you give it a shot ðŸ™‚ .
